---

## Purpose & Goals

Transform the React typewriter animation library to be a **modern, effective, performant, and lightweight** solution that provides:

- **Modern React compatibility**: Full support for React 19, server components, and concurrent features
- **Superior performance**: Optimized rendering, minimal bundle size, and efficient memory usage
- **Developer experience**: Excellent TypeScript support, intuitive API, and comprehensive documentation
- **Universal compatibility**: SSR/RSC support, server components, and seamless hydration
- **Accessibility first**: Screen reader support, ARIA compliance, and inclusive design
- **Production ready**: Robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and battle-tested reliability

The goal is to create the definitive typewriter animation library for React that developers can confidently use in any modern React application, from simple client-side apps to complex server-rendered applications.

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Issues

- **Memory leaks**: `activeInterval` not properly cleaned up, recursive `start()` calls in loop mode
- **Poor DOM manipulation**: Direct DOM manipulation instead of React patterns
- **Type safety gaps**: Generic HTML element refs, missing proper error handling
- **Performance issues**: Inefficient character-by-character DOM operations
- **React anti-patterns**: Side effects in render, direct DOM manipulation
- **Bundle size**: Global style injection, unnecessary DOM operations
- **Accessibility**: No ARIA support, screen reader compatibility missing
- **Server compatibility**: No SSR/RSC support, DOM operations on server

### Performance Considerations

**Current DOM manipulation issues:**

- Character-by-character DOM insertions (expensive)
- No batching of updates
- Memory leaks from intervals
- Forced reflows on each character

**State-driven benefits:**

- React's batching and reconciliation
- Virtual DOM optimizations
- Proper cleanup with useEffect
- Can optimize with useMemo/useCallback
- Better for SSR/hydration
